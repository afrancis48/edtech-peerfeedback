                Online classes are often thought to be very isolating, but Peer
                Feedback in our class has played an enormous role in building a
                community of online students. It isn’t just about getting
                students a few lines of extra feedback on their assignments:
                it’s about building camaraderie among an otherwise distributed
                student body. Seeing what your classmates are struggling with,
                the unexpected solutions they found, and what insights you can
                provide helps create a strong class community where one might
                not otherwise spring up.

            Challenges
          </h2>
          <p>
            In order to make
            <abbr title="Online Master of Science in Computer Science">
              OMSCS
            </abbr>
            feasible, the program counts with very large classroom sizes e.g.
            over two hundred students.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sheer scale of the program makes grading and providing feedback
            a significant challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, its online nature poses large issues regarding
            isolation and lack of interaction.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>The Challenge of Community in Online Education</h3>
          <p>
            Lack of interaction and isolation in large online classrooms can
            greatly limit the student experience in online education.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lack of togetherness and fellowship</li>
            <li>Privation from shared insights and solutions</li>
            <li>Reduced engagement</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>
              With no solution at hand, an educational program can greatly in
              quality in its transition to the Web.

          <h3>The Challenge of Feedback in Large Classrooms</h3>
          <p>
            The
            <abbr title="Online Master of Science in Computer Science">
              OMSCS
            </abbr>
            program has tackled the challenge of grading and providing feedback
            to extremely large courses by hiring a sizable number of teaching
            assistants (TAs) for each course and by automating grading as much
            as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, many of the coding assignments are automatically graded
            by robo-graders and when necessary the TAs step in to manually
            evaluate assignments and provide feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            However,
            <strong>
              even with a large team of TAs, grading and providing feedback for
              feedback for open-ended assignments such as essays and design
              documents remains a challenge.

            From its very beginnings, several
            <abbr title="Online Master of Science in Computer Science">
              OMSCS
            </abbr>
            courses experimented with peer feedback as a tool to improve
            feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to facilitate these experiments with peer feedback, the
            aptly named tool Peer Feedback was designed from scratch with large
            online courses in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              As per student provided feedback on feedback, 80% of students who
              reviewed the feedback they received, rated it as positive.
